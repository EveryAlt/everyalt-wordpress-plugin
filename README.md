# 🖼️ EveryAlt — Alt text for every image. **Zero limits. Totally free.**

<p align="center">
  <strong>🆓 100% free</strong> · <strong>♾️ No limits from us</strong> · <strong>🔑 Your OpenAI key</strong>
</p>

> **EveryAlt 1.0 is 100% free.** Bring your own [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), and generate as much alt text as you want. We don’t meter you, cap you, or bill you. **Ever.**

---

## ✨ What is this?

**EveryAlt** is a WordPress plugin that uses AI to write **alternative text** for your images. One click (or automatic on upload), and you get clear, descriptive alt text — better accessibility, happier search engines, and ADA-friendly media.

No more blank alt fields. No more guessing. **You upload. EveryAlt writes.**

## 🎉 Why 1.0 is different

| Before | **EveryAlt 1.0** |
|--------|------------------|
| Limits, tiers, or paywalls | **Unlimited** — your key, your usage |
| Extra service to sign up for | **Just OpenAI** — one key, one place |
| Opaque pricing | **Transparent** — you pay OpenAI only |

We don’t charge. We don’t sit in the middle. You use **your** OpenAI key. EveryAlt stays **free**, and you have **no limits** from us.

## 🚀 What you can do

- **Auto-generate on upload** — New images get alt text as soon as they hit the Media Library.
- **Bulk generate** — Fix hundreds of images without alt text in one go.
- **Review & edit** — See everything that already has alt text; edit or regenerate anytime.
- **In the block editor** — Generate or regenerate alt text right from the Image block.
- **On the media screen** — Button next to the alt field for single images.
- **Logs & export** — See what ran, what cost what, and export as CSV.

Works on localhost, behind HTTP auth, and with your existing workflow.
